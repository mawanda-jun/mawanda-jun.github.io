Hi there! I am a graduating CS student of the University of Padova (Italy) and I am specializing in the deep learning field. 

I am still working on this site to keep trace of the papers I read and comment and of the competitions and projects I enjoy. Therefore, you'd take this webpage as a draft.

You may find some insights of my recent works under "Competitions". The rest of the webpage is under maintenance; still, most of my projects are in my GitHub profile, so if you are interested in more insight you may take a look over there.
