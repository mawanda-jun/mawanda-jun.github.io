Hi there! I am a graduating CS student of the University of Padova (Italy) and I am specializing in the deep learning field. 

I am still working on this site to keep trace of the papers I read and comment. Therefore, you'd take it as a draft.

You may find my paper considerations in the "Blog" page, and the comments to some competitions I enjoyed in "Competitions".
